Signagerableio is a project assigned by [Trelora](http://www.trelora.com/) (a Real Estate Agency located in Denver) that aims to help them be able to have an admin interface that controls what is being displayed on the multiple TVs located in their building. They wanted to have more control on being able to render houses that were either coming soon to the market or have successfully been sold from their client's.

## Features
- Every day at midnight there's a scheduler that calls on a rake task that "refreshes" the types of roles and slides that will be displayed on the devices

- Admin is able to manually "refresh" their slides and roles whenever Trelora ends up updating their API

- Admin is able to select the amount of seconds they'd like in between the transition for the slides
